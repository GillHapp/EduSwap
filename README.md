# **AquaDex - Decentralized Exchange on EDU Testnet Chain**

**AquaDex** is a cutting-edge **Automated Market Maker (AMM)** protocol built on the **EDU Testnet Chain**. It provides a seamless and decentralized platform for liquidity provision and token swaps between the **EDU** (native token) and **DEDU** (derived token) pairs. By empowering liquidity providers (LPs) with transaction fee rewards, AquaDex ensures an efficient and user-friendly DeFi ecosystem tailored to the EDU network.

## üåê **Overview**

**AquaDex** is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that uses an **Automated Market Maker (AMM)** model to facilitate token swaps and liquidity provision. Designed specifically for the **EDU Testnet Chain**, AquaDex allows users to interact with **EDU** and **DEDU** tokens in a fast, secure, and trustless environment.

Liquidity providers (LPs) play a crucial role in maintaining the health of the exchange by contributing to the **EDU/DEDU** liquidity pool. In return, LPs earn rewards through transaction fees, creating a robust and dynamic decentralized finance (DeFi) platform.

### **Core Features**
- **Add Liquidity:** Users can deposit **EDU** and **DEDU** tokens in equal amounts to contribute to the liquidity pool and receive LP tokens as proof of their share.
- **Remove Liquidity:** LPs can withdraw their liquidity and receive a proportional amount of **EDU** and **DEDU** tokens.
- **Token Swap:** Perform instant token swaps between **EDU** and **DEDU**, with prices automatically set by the liquidity pool.
- **EDU Testnet Compatibility:** AquaDex is deployed on the **EDU Testnet Chain**, ensuring low fees and seamless blockchain integration for developers and users.

---

## üí° **Features**

- **Seamless Liquidity Provision:** Add or remove liquidity easily through an intuitive interface.
- **Instant Token Swaps:** Swap **EDU** and **DEDU** tokens without intermediaries, with pricing based on the liquidity pool's algorithm.
- **Transaction Fee Rewards:** LPs earn a share of transaction fees, incentivizing long-term participation.
- **Testnet Optimization:** AquaDex is optimized for the **EDU Testnet Chain**, providing a reliable environment for development and testing without incurring real costs.

## üöÄ **Getting Started**

To get started with **AquaDex**, follow the steps below to set up your development environment and interact with the protocol.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Prerequisites**

1. **Node.js**: [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Recommended: LTS version).  
2. **Metamask**: [Install Metamask](https://metamask.io/) for secure interaction with the EDU Testnet.  
3. **EDU Testnet Configuration**: Add the **EDU Testnet Chain** to your Metamask wallet using the appropriate RPC URL and chain ID.

### üì¶ **Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GillHapp/EduSwap.git
   cd EduSwap
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### üèÉ **Running the Project**

1. Ensure your Metamask wallet is connected to the **EDU Testnet Chain**.  
2. Start the development server:  
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to interact with AquaDex.

## üìú **Smart Contracts**

AquaDex is powered by smart contracts that handle liquidity management and token swaps in a secure and decentralized manner.

### ‚ûï **Liquidity Add Function**

The `addLiquidity` function allows users to add equal amounts of **EDU** and **DEDU** tokens to the liquidity pool. LP tokens are issued as proof of contribution.

```solidity
function addLiquidity(uint256 _eduAmount) external returns (bool) {
    require(_eduAmount > 0, "Amount must be greater than zero");

    uint256 deduAmount = calculateRequiredDEDU(_eduAmount);
    require(DEDU.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= deduAmount, "Insufficient DEDU balance");

    EDU.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _eduAmount);
    DEDU.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), deduAmount);

    _mintLP(msg.sender, _eduAmount);
    return true;
}
```

### ‚ûñ **Liquidity Remove Function**

The `removeLiquidity` function enables LPs to withdraw their liquidity from the pool, receiving both **EDU** and **DEDU** tokens in proportion to their share.

```solidity
function removeLiquidity(uint256 _lpTokens) external returns (uint256, uint256) {
    require(_lpTokens > 0, "Amount must be greater than zero");

    uint256 eduAmount = calculateEDUForLP(_lpTokens);
    uint256 deduAmount = calculateDEDUForLP(_lpTokens);

    _burnLP(msg.sender, _lpTokens);
    EDU.transfer(msg.sender, eduAmount);
    DEDU.transfer(msg.sender, deduAmount);

    return (eduAmount, deduAmount);
}
```
